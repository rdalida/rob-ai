<p>Welcome! In this walkthrough, we'll explore how <span class="highlight-gold">Large Language Models (LLMs)</span> like <strong>ChatGPT</strong> understand and generate text.</p>

<p>We'll break down each step â€” from how your prompt is <em>tokenized</em>, to how the model predicts and builds responses <span style="color:#0ff;">one token at a time</span>.</p>

<p>No AI background needed â€” just curiosity. <br/>Let's get started!</p>

    note: `
<p>When you ask ChatGPT something, you're giving it a <strong>prompt</strong>.</p>

<p>Before the model can understand it, your words are broken down into smaller pieces called <span class="highlight-gold">tokens</span>. This process is called <em>tokenization</em>.</p>

<p>Each token is converted into a unique number called a <span class="highlight-gold">token ID</span>. These aren't always full words â€” they might be whole words, parts of words like <code>capi</code> and <code>tal</code>, or even just punctuation.</p>

<p>These token IDs are what the model actually sees. It uses them to predict what comes next â€” one token at a time.</p>

    content: `The capital of France is Paris.`,
    note: `
<p>Once the LLM understands your prompt, it starts generating a response â€” <strong>one token at a time</strong>.</p>

<p>It looks at everything it's seen so far (your question and its own previous words), and predicts the <em>most likely next token</em>.</p>

<p>Then it adds that token to the context, and repeats the process â€” again and again â€” until it decides the answer is complete.</p>
